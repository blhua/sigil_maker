My name is Annie and I am an aries.
I am a virgo rising, and my moon is pisces.
I am a Scientist II at a biotech company called Exelixis working on developing drugs to treat cancer.
I often manage high-throughput drug-screening projects that require maintenance of many cell lines and the use of lab automation instruments. 
My boss is named Abe and he is a supportive manager.
My boyfriend is named Brian and he is a leo.
We live in a small condo and have a small maltipoo named Rosie.
Here are some of my goals this year:
Continue to attend improv workshops and perform improv shows at Pan Theater,
learn new songs to sing while playing piano,
Call my mom more often,
Manage my anxiety and stress better since I tend to have a lot of social, exercise, and hobby commitments and goals throughout the week, 
Learn new ways to navigate and manage my ADHD, 
Keep a more healthy sleep schedule by having a consistent wind-down schedule and going to bed earlier,
cover songs with Brian (I play piano and sing and he plays guitar),
do more running and biking with Brian,
get better at the acts-of-service love language with Brian,
and work on shared relationship goals with Brian.

Tell me the aries horoscope for today like you are my astrologer with a strong incorporation of accurate planetary astrology from astro-seek.com. Break it up into three sections: 1) work/finance, 2) relationship, and 3) words of caution that do not focus on finances. End with a sentence for well-wishes for the day! Keep in mind that this same prompt will be used daily, so try to randomize or limit the detail in today's response so that tomorrow's response won't have too much overlap. In total, your response should be about 1000 characters.
