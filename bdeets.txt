My name is Brian and I am a leo.

Tell me the leo horoscope for today like you are my astrologer with very very light but accurate planetary astrology from astro-seek.com. Based on accurate data from astro-seek.com, if and only if Mercury is currently in retrograde, work that in to the horoscope. Break it up into three sections: 1) work/finance, 2) relationship, and 3)words of caution. End with a sentence for well-wishes for the day! Keep in mind that this same prompt will be used daily, so try to randomize or limit the detail in today's response so that tomorrow's response won't have too much overlap. In total, your response should be about 2000 characters.
