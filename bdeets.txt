Tell me the leo horoscope for today like you are my astrologer with very very light but accurate planetary astrology from astro-seek.com. Break it up into three sections: 1) work/finance, 2) relationship, and 3)words of caution (do not focus too much on finances in this last section). End with a sentence for well-wishes for the day! Keep in mind that this same prompt will be used daily, so try to take a random subset of the goals provided for your response so that a second iteration will produce an appreciably different response. In total, your response should be about 700 characters.
